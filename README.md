A smart book recommendation system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide personalized book suggestions based on natural language descriptions, emotional tones, and categories.

## üîó Live Demo

Experience the Semantic Book Recommender in action:  
[Semantic Book Recommender on HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Onyimatics/Semantic_Book_Recommender)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Search**: Describe the type of book you're looking for in plain language
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses OpenAI embeddings to deeply understand book content and match your interests
- **Emotional Tone Filtering**: Find books with specific emotional qualities (Happy, Sad, Suspenseful, etc.)
- **Category Filtering**: Narrow recommendations by book genre/category
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive Gradio UI with visual book gallery and descriptions
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements smart caching to reduce API calls and speed up recommendations

## üìö Dataset

The project uses the "7k Books with Metadata" dataset from Kaggle, enhanced with:
- Emotional analysis (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise)
- Simplified category classification
- Processed text descriptions optimized for semantic search

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Gradio**: Interactive UI with responsive gallery layout
- **LangChain**: Document processing and embedding integration
- **OpenAI**: API for generating high-quality semantic embeddings
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for similarity search
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Core Application**:
  - `gradio-dashboard.py`: Main application with UI and recommendation engine

- **Data Processing & Analysis**:
  - `data-exploration.ipynb`: Initial dataset exploration and cleaning
  - `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`: Emotional tone extraction from book descriptions
  - `text-classification.ipynb`: Book category classification
  - `vector-search.ipynb`: Testing and development of semantic search functionality

- **Data Files**:
  - `books_cleaned.csv`: Processed dataset with complete metadata
  - `books_with_emotions.csv`: Dataset enhanced with emotional analysis
  - `books_with_categories.csv`: Dataset with categorization
  - `tagged_description.txt`: Text file with processed descriptions for embedding

- **System Files**:
  - `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
  - `cache/`: Directory for stored embeddings to optimize performance
  - `chroma_db_books/`: ChromaDB vector database files

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ 
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-book-recommender.git
   cd llm-book-recommender
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python gradio-dashboard.py
   ```

5. Access the UI in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:7860

## üí° How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: Book descriptions are processed and embedded using OpenAI's embedding model.
2. **User Query**: You describe the kind of book you want in natural language.
3. **Semantic Search**: The system finds books with similar semantic meaning to your query.
4. **Filtering**: Results are filtered by category and emotional tone if specified.
5. **Presentation**: Top recommendations are displayed with book covers and descriptions.
