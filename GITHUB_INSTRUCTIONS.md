# How to Push This Project to GitHub

Follow these steps to push your local repository to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., "llm-book-recommender")
4. Optionally, add a description
5. Choose whether the repository should be public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have these files locally)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-book-recommender.git

# Verify that the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify the Push

1. Go to your GitHub repository page (https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-book-recommender)
2. You should see all your files, including the README.md and the data-exploration.ipynb

## 4. Future Pushes

For future changes, you can simply use:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

## Note on Large Files

If you have trouble pushing large files (like the CSV file), you might need to use Git LFS (Large File Storage). However, the current setup with the .gitignore should handle this appropriately.
